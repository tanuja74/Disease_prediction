The project involves data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation. Additionally, a user-friendly web interface has been created using Streamlit to allow users to input data and get predictions.

Dataset
The project utilizes datasets from various sources to predict the following diseases:

Heart Disease Diabetes Parkinson's Disease Each dataset contains relevant features and labels for training and evaluating the models.

Features
The features vary depending on the disease being predicted. Common features include:

Age Gender Blood Pressure Cholesterol Levels Blood Sugar Levels Heart Rate Tremor Severity (for Parkinson's Disease) Other relevant medical metrics

Classification Algorithms
The following classification algorithms were evaluated in this project:

Logistic Regression Decision Tree Classifier Random Forest Classifier Support Vector Machine (SVM) k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)

Web Interface
The web interface allows users to input medical data and receive predictions for Heart Disease, Diabetes, and Parkinson's Disease. The application is deployed on Streamlit and can be accessed online.The Link is provided below https://mlmdspred-kjxvkwyuscgqst33ejayfn.streamlit.app

Results The performance of each classification model was evaluated using the following metrics:

Accuracy Precision Recall F1 Score Confusion Matrix The results indicate good accuracy for each disease prediction model.
